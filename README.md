- 👋 Hi, I’m @amnon-tal
- 👀 I’m interested in Mathematics and computer science. Specifically, I love abstract algebra and in computer science I'm currently doing stuff in web development in my little free time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - Field and Galois theory
  - Multivariate Integral calculus
  - Elementary set theory
  - A course on algorithms
  - A course in C and C++, although I kinda know them already
  - On the side I also learn some web development
<!--- - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... --->
- 📫 How to reach me: Currently only through my university email, amnon.tal@mail.huji.ac.il. Might change in the near future though!
